# IGAflexiblewidth
Quick update for IGA Wuhan theme

Idea is to remove the fixed width and to make it into a flexible width
as such the images are mostly removed

Overall state is a bit rough and ready - check style-ian.css for the working copy
See the new css by opening a HTML page marked _new 
Tested in IE,Chrome, and Safari - seemed reasonable for the selection of page types I identified.


Bad things:
The no sidebar part is not updated, but I couldn't find any instance of this page on the website.
The header.jpg is still set up for 900 pixels, that ought to be changed.
